This repository hosts a complete workshop on `Reactor Netty`.

When finishing the workshop one will know how to create and utilize:

* `UDP` server and client
* `TCP` server and client
* `HTTP` server and client

Reference documentation can be useful while creating those servers and clients:

* http://next.projectreactor.io/docs/netty/snapshot/api/[Reactor Netty javadoc]
* http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/[Reactor Core javadoc]
* http://netty.io/wiki/index.html[Netty documentation] (Reactor Netty uses Netty 4.1.x)

== Prerequisites

* `Java 8`
* `Java IDE` installed with `Maven` support

== How to start

* Clone/fork this repository https://github.com/violetagg/reactor-netty-workshop
* Import the project as `Maven` one in your `IDE`

package in order to make the unit tests green
* The solution is available in the `complete` branch for comparison. Each step of this workshop
has its companion commit in the git history with a detailed commit message.

== UDP server and client
If one wants to utilize the `UDP` protocol one will need to create a `UDP` servers that can send packages
to each other or even `UDP` clients that can connect to specific `UDP` servers.
`Reactor Netty` provides easy to use and configure `UdpServer` and `UdpClient`, they hide most of the
`Netty` functionality that is needed in order to create `UDP` server and client, and in addition add
`Reactive Streams` backpressure.

=== Creating UDP server
`UdpServer` allows to build, configure and materialize a `UDP` server.
Invoking `UdpServer.create()` one can prepare the `UDP` server for configuration. Having already a `UdpServer`
instance, one can start configuring the host, port, the IO handler etc.
For configuration purposes, an immutable builder pattern is used which inherits configurations
from left to right, and when materializing the real object, the configurations are applied from right to left.
So the most recent configuration of a type will override the previous. In the example below the `UDP` server will
be bound on port `8080` and will not use a random port.

[source, java]
----
UdpServer.create()  // Prepares a UDP server for configuration.
         .port(0)   // Configures the port number as zero, this will let the system
                    // pick up an ephemeral port when binding the server.
         .port(8080)// Configures the port number as 8080.
         .bind()    // Binds the UDP server and returns a Mono<Connection>.
         .block();  // Blocks and waits the server to finish initialising.
----

When finished with the server configuration, invoking `UdpServer.bind()`, one will bind the server
and `Mono<Connection>` will be return, subscribing to this `Publisher` one can react
on a successfully finished operation or handle issues that might happen. On the other hand
cancelling this `Mono`, the underlying binding will be aborted. If one do not need to interact with the `Mono`,
there is `UdpServer.bindNow(Duration)` which is a convenient method for binding the server and obtaining the
`Connection`.
The `Connection` that is emitted as a result of a successfully bound server, holds contextual information
for the underlying channel and provides a non-blocking resource disposing API.
Disposing resource is very important so once the server is not necessary anymore, it must be disposed
by the user via `Connection.dispose()` or `Connection.disposeNow()`. The difference between these two methods is
that the second one will release the resources and close the underlying channel in a blocking fashion.

=== Configuring UDP server
==== Configuring the Wire Logger
There are use case when one wants to enable a wire logger in order to understand what's wrong with the server.
For that purposes `UdpServer.wiretap` can be used and this will use `reactor.netty.udp.UdpServer` category
with `DEBUG` level. There are also `UdpServer.wiretap(String)` and `UdpServer.wiretap(String, LogLevel)` so that
one can change the category and the log level.

==== Configuring the Event Loop Group
By default the `UDP` server will use Event Loop Group where the number of the worker threads will be
the number of processors available to the runtime on init (but with a minimum value of 4). When
one needs a different configuration, one of the `LoopResource.create` methods can be used in order to configure a new
Event Loop Group. Once the Event Loop Group is configured, the new configuration can be provided using one of the
`UdpServer.runOn`.

=== Add UDP server IO handler that will echo the received package
`UdpServer.handle(BiFunction<UdpInbound, UdpOutbound, Publisher<Void>>)` should be used if one wants to attach IO
handler that will process the incoming packages and will eventually send packages as reply.
`UdpInbound` is used to receive bytes from the peer where `UdpInbound.receiveObject()` returns the pure inbound
`Flux`, while `UdpInbound.receive()` returns `ByteBufFlux` which provides an extra API to handle the incoming traffic.
`UdpOutbound` is used to send bytes to the peer, listen for any error returned by the write operation
and close on terminal  signal (complete|error). If more than one `Publisher` is attached
(multiple calls to `UdpOutbound.send*` methods), completion occurs when all publishers complete.
The `Publisher<Void>` that has to be returned as a result represents the sequence of the operations that will be
applied for the incoming and outgoing traffic.
The packages that will be received and that will be send are handled by `io.netty.channel.socket.DatagramPacket`.
For example if one wants to transform an incoming package and then to prepare a new one for sending, the snippet bellow
can be used:

[source, java]
----
if (o instanceof DatagramPacket) {
    // Incoming DatagramPacket
    DatagramPacket p = (DatagramPacket) o;
    ByteBuf buf1 = Unpooled.copiedBuffer("Hello ", CharsetUtil.UTF_8);
    // Creates a new ByteBuf using the incoming DatagramPacket content.
    ByteBuf buf2 = Unpooled.copiedBuffer(buf1, p.content()
                                                .retain());
    // Creates a new DatagramPacket with the ByteBuf and the sender
    // information from the incoming DatagramPacket.
    return new DatagramPacket(buf2, p.sender());
}
----

=== Creating UDP client
`UdpClient` allows to build, configure and materialize a `UDP` client.
Invoking `UdpClient.create()` one can prepare the `UDP` client for configuration. Having already a `UdpClient`
instance, one can start configuring the host, port, the IO handler etc.
For configuration purposes, the same immutable builder pattern is used as in `UdpServer`.

When finished with the client configuration, invoking `UdpClient.connect()`, one will connect the client
and `Mono<Connection>` will be return, subscribing to this `Publisher` one can react
on a successfully finished operation or handle issues that might happen. On the other hand
cancelling this `Mono`, the underlying connecting operation will be aborted. If one do not need to interact with the
`Mono`, there is `UdpClient.connectNow(Duration)` which is a convenient method for connecting the client and obtaining
the `Connection`.
As already described in the `UDP` server section, disposing the resources can be done via `Connection.dispose()`
or `Connection.disposeNow()`.

=== Configuring UDP client
==== Configuring the Wire Logger
`UdpClient.wiretap` can be used for wire logging and this will use `reactor.netty.udp.UdpClient` category
with `DEBUG` level. There are also `UdpClient.wiretap(String)` and `UdpClient.wiretap(String, LogLevel)` so that
one can change the category and the log level.

==== Configuring the Event Loop Group
The default configuration for the Event Loop Group is the same as in `UDP` server.
When one needs a different configuration, `UdpClient.runOn` methods can be used.

=== Add UDP client IO handler that will send a package and will react on an incoming packages
`UdpClient.handle(BiFunction<UdpInbound, UdpOutbound, Publisher<Void>>)` should be used if one wants to attach IO
handler that will process the incoming packages and will eventually send packages as reply.
Here as a convenience `UdpOutbound.send*` (e.g. `UdpOutbound.sendString`) methods can be used instead of
`UdpOutbound.sendObject` as the client is connected to exactly one `UDP` server. The same is also for
using `UdpInbound.receive()` instead of `UdpInbound.receiveObject()`.

=== Utilize Mono<Connection>
In the section for the `UDP` server creation was described that as a result of `UdpServer.bind` one will
receive `Mono<Connection>` which will emit (complete|error) signals.
Utilizing this `Mono` one can send a datagram package (the snippet below) as soon as the `UDP` server is
bound successfully.

[source, java]
----
DatagramChannel udp = DatagramChannel.open();
udp.configureBlocking(true);
udp.connect(new InetSocketAddress(server1.address().getPort()));

byte[] data = new byte[1024];
new Random().nextBytes(data);
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    udp.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(data));
}

udp.close();
----

== TCP server and client
If one wants to utilize the `TCP` protocol one will need to create a `TCP` servers that can send packages
to the connected clients or `TCP` clients that can connect to specific `TCP` servers.
`Reactor Netty` provides easy to use and configure `TcpServer` and `TcpClient`, they hide most of the
`Netty` functionality that is needed in order to create with `TCP` server and client, and in addition add
`Reactive Streams` backpressure.

=== Creating TCP server
`TcpServer` allows to build, configure and materialize a `TCP` server.
Invoking `TcpServer.create()` one can prepare the `TCP` server for configuration. Having already a `TcpServer`
instance, one can start configuring the host, port, the IO handler etc.
For configuration purposes, the same immutable builder pattern is used as in `UdpServer`.

When finished with the server configuration, invoking `TcpServer.bind`, one will bind the server
and `Mono<DisposableServer>` will be return, subscribing to this `Publisher` one can react
on a successfully finished operation or handle issues that might happen. On the other hand
cancelling this `Mono`, the underlying connecting operation will be aborted. If one do not need to interact with the
`Mono`, there is `TcpServer.bindNow(Duration)` which is a convenient method for binding the server and obtaining
the `DisposableServer`.
`DisposableServer` holds contextual information for the underlying server.
Disposing the resources can be done via `DisposableServer.dispose()` or `DisposableServer.disposeNow()`.

=== Enabling SSL support for TCP server
`TcpServer` provides several convenient methods for configuring SSL.
When one wants to use the default SSL configuration provided by Reactor Netty `TcpServer.secure()` can be used.
If additional configuration is necessary then one of the following methods can be used:

* `TcpServer.secure(SslContext)` where SslContext is already configured
* `TcpServer.secure(Consumer<? super SslProvider.SslContextSpec>)` where the SSL configuration customization
can be done via the passed builder.

=== Add TCP server IO handler that will send a file
`TcpServer.handle(BiFunction<NettyInbound, NettyOutbound, Publisher<Void>>)` should be used if one wants to attach IO
handler that will process the incoming messages and will eventually send messages as a reply.
`NettyInbound` is used to receive bytes from the peer where `NettyInbound.receiveObject()` returns the pure inbound
`Flux`, while `NettyInbound.receive()` returns `ByteBufFlux` which provides an extra API to handle the incoming traffic.
`NettyOutbound` is used to send bytes to the peer, listen for any error returned by the write operation
and close on terminal  signal (complete|error). If more than one `Publisher` is attached
(multiple calls to `NettyOutbound.send*` methods), completion occurs when all publishers complete.
The `Publisher<Void>` that has to be returned as a result represents the sequence of the operations that will be
applied for the incoming and outgoing traffic.
For example if one wants to send a file to the client where the file name is received as an incoming package,
the snippet bellow can be used:

[source, java]
----
.handle((in, out) ->
        in.receive()
          .asString()
          .flatMap(s -> {
              try {
                  Path file = Paths.get(getClass().getResource(s).toURI());
                  return out.sendFile(file)
                            .then();
              } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
                  return Mono.error(e);
              }
          }))
----

=== Creating TCP client
`TcpClient` allows to build, configure and materialize a `TCP` client.
Invoking `TcpClient.create()` one can prepare the `TCP` client for configuration. Having already a `TcpClient`
instance, one can start configuring the host, port, the IO handler etc.
For configuration purposes, the same immutable builder pattern is used as in `UdpServer`.

When finished with the client configuration, invoking `TcpClient.connect()`, one will connect the client
and `Mono<Connection>` will be return, subscribing to this `Publisher` one can react
on a successfully finished operation or handle issues that might happen. On the other hand
cancelling this `Mono`, the underlying connecting operation will be aborted. If one do not need to interact with the
`Mono`, there is `TcpClient.connectNow(Duration)` which is a convenient method for connecting the client and obtaining
the `Connection`.
As already described in the `UDP` server section, disposing the resources can be done via `Connection.dispose()`
or `Connection.disposeNow()`.

=== Enabling SSL support for TCP client
`TcpClient` provides several convenient methods for configuring SSL.
When one wants to use the default SSL configuration provided by Reactor Netty `TcpClient.secure()` can be used.
If additional configuration is necessary then one of the following methods can be used:

* `TcpClient.secure(SslContext)` where SslContext is already configured
* `TcpClient.secure(Consumer<? super SslProvider.SslContextSpec>)` where the SSL configuration customization
can be done via the passed builder.

=== Add TCP client IO handler
`TcpClient.handle(BiFunction<NettyInbound, NettyOutbound, Publisher<Void>>)` should be used if one wants to attach IO
handler that will process the incoming messages and will eventually send messages as reply.
Here as a convenience `NettyOutbound.send*` (e.g. `NettyOutbound.sendString`) methods can be used instead of
`NettyOutbound.sendObject`. The same is also for using `NettyInbound.receive()` instead of
`NettyInbound.receiveObject()`.

== HTTP server and client
=== Creating HTTP server
`HttpServer` allows to build, configure and materialize a `HTTP` server.
Invoking `HttpServer.create()` one can prepare the `HTTP` server for configuration. Having already a `HttpServer`
instance, one can start configuring the host, port, the IO handler, compression etc.
For configuration purposes, the same immutable builder pattern is used as in `UdpServer`.

When finished with the server configuration, invoking `HttpServer.bind`, one will bind the server
and `Mono<DisposableServer>` will be return, subscribing to this `Publisher` one can react
on a successfully finished operation or handle issues that might happen. On the other hand
cancelling this `Mono`, the underlying connecting operation will be aborted. If one do not need to interact with the
`Mono`, there is `HttpServer.bindNow(Duration)` which is a convenient method for binding the server and obtaining
the `DisposableServer`.
Disposing the resources can be done via `DisposableServer.dispose()` or `DisposableServer.disposeNow()`.

=== Defining routes for the HTTP server
In `HttpServer` one can handle the incoming requests and outgoing responses using
`HttpServer.handle(BiFunction<HttpServerRequest, HttpServerResponse, Publisher<Void>>)` which is similar to the
mechanism that was already described for `UdpServer`/`TcpServer`. However there is also a possibility to specify
concrete routes and HTTP methods that the server will respond. This can be done using
`HttpServer.route(Consumer<HttpServerRoutes>)`. Using `HttpServerRoutes` one can specify the HTTP method, paths etc.
For example the snippet below specifies that the server will respond only on `POST` method, where the path starts with
`/test` and has a path parameter.

[source, java]
----
.route(routes ->
        routes.post("/test/{param}", (req, res) ->
                res.sendString(req.receive()
                                  .asString()
                                  .map(s -> s + ' ' + req.param("param") + '!'))))
----

`HttpServerRequest` provides API for accessing http request attributes as method, path, headers, path parameters etc.
as well as to receive the request body.
`HttpServerResponse` provides API for accessing http response attributes as status code, headers, compression etc.
as well as to send the response body.

=== Creating HTTP client
`HttpClient` allows to build, configure and materialize a `HTTP` client.
Invoking `HttpClient.create()` one can prepare the `HTTP` client for configuration. Having already a `HttpClient`
instance, one can start configuring the host, port, headers, compression etc.
For configuration purposes, the same immutable builder pattern is used as in `UdpServer`.

When finished with the client configuration, invoking `HttpClient.get|post|...` methods, one will receive
`HttpClient.RequestSender` and will be able start configuring the `HTTP` request such as the uri and the request body.
`HttpClient.RequestSender.send*` will end the HTTP request's configuration and one can start discribing the actions
on the `HTTP` response when it is received on the returned `HttpClient.ResponseReceiver`, the response body can be obtained via the provided
`HttpClient.ResponseReceiver.response*` methods. As `HttpClient.ResponseReceiver` API always returns `Publisher`,
the request and response executions are always deferred to the moment when there is a `Subscriber`
that subscribes to the defined sequence. For example in the snippet below `block()` will subscribe to the defined
sequence and in fact will trigger the execution.

In the snippet below can be used to send POST request with a body and received the answer from the server:

[source, java]
----
HttpClient.create()             // Prepares a HTTP client for configuration.
          .port(server.port())  // Obtain the server's port and provide it as a port to which this
                                // client should connect.
          .wiretap()            // Applies a wire logger configuration.
          .headers(h -> h.add("Content-Type", "text/plain")) // Adds headers to the HTTP request.
          .post()              // Specifies that POST method will be used.
          .uri("/test/World")  // Specifies the path.
          .send(ByteBufFlux.fromString(Flux.just("Hello")))  // Sends the request body.
          .responseContent()   // Receives the response body.
          .aggregate()
          .asString()
          .block();
